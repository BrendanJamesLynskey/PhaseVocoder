# Audio Time-Stretching & Pitch-Shifting Toolkit

Two desktop applications for Windows 11 that manipulate audio using different mathematical approaches to time-frequency analysis. Both offer real-time visualisation, microphone recording, and WAV export through identical UI layouts — making them ideal for comparing how STFT and CWT handle the same audio material.

## Applications

### Phase Vocoder (`phase_vocoder.py`)

Uses the **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** — the industry-standard approach. The signal is divided into overlapping windowed frames, transformed to the frequency domain, and resynthesised via overlap-add after manipulating magnitude and phase.

**Time-stretching** works by reading through the spectrogram at a modified rate while accumulating phase at each bin's instantaneous frequency. **Pitch-shifting** combines time-stretching with polyphase resampling.

- Configurable FFT size (512–8192) and hop size (128–1024)
- Near-perfect reconstruction via COLA-compliant overlap-add
- Lower computational cost than the wavelet approach
- Best suited for tonal material (vocals, sustained instruments)

### Wavelet Processor (`wavelet_processor.py`)

Uses the **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)** with Morlet wavelets. Instead of fixed-size FFT windows, the signal is analysed with wavelets whose time support adapts to frequency — short wavelets at high frequencies, long wavelets at low frequencies.

**Time-stretching** interpolates magnitude envelopes across scales and resynthesises phase by integrating the instantaneous frequency at each scale. A residual-preservation strategy maintains full-bandwidth fidelity. **Pitch-shifting** uses the same stretch-plus-resample approach.

- Configurable voices (24–96) and frequency range (20–20,000 Hz)
- Logarithmic frequency resolution matching human auditory perception
- Better transient preservation on percussive material
- Approximate reconstruction compensated by least-squares scaling

## Features

Both applications share an identical control layout:

- **Load WAV** or **record from microphone** (up to 30 seconds)
- **Time-stretch** from 0.25× to 4.0×
- **Pitch-shift** from −12 to +12 semitones
- **Side-by-side visualisation** — spectrograms (phase vocoder) or scalograms (wavelet)
- **Playback** of original and processed audio
- **Export** to WAV
- **Dark-themed UI** with parameter reset buttons

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Windows 11 (audio I/O tested against WASAPI/DirectSound)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrendanJamesLynskey/PhaseVocoder.git
cd audio-stretch-pitch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

```
numpy
scipy
sounddevice
soundfile
matplotlib
```

If `sounddevice` fails to install, you may need the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Run

```bash
python phase_vocoder.py
python wavelet_processor.py
```

## How They Work

### Phase Vocoder — STFT Approach

```
Input → Window → FFT → [Spectrogram] → Interpolate magnitudes
                                       → Accumulate phase at instantaneous frequency
                                       → IFFT → Overlap-add → Output
```

1. The input is segmented into overlapping frames (default: 2048-sample Hann window, 512-sample hop = 75% overlap).
2. Each frame is FFT'd to produce a complex spectrogram with 1025 frequency bins.
3. For time-stretching, output frames are generated by stepping through the spectrogram at `1/stretch_factor` intervals. Magnitudes are linearly interpolated; phase is propagated by computing the instantaneous frequency from inter-frame phase differences, then accumulating at the synthesis rate.
4. The inverse FFT and overlap-add with squared-window normalisation reconstruct the time-domain signal.

### Wavelet Processor — CWT Approach

```
Input → CWT (Morlet) → [Scalogram] → Interpolate magnitudes
                                     → Integrate instantaneous frequency for phase
                                     → iCWT + residual blending → Output
```

1. The input is convolved with Morlet wavelets at 64 logarithmically-spaced scales spanning 20–20,000 Hz.
2. For time-stretching, the magnitude envelope and instantaneous frequency at each scale are interpolated to the target length. Phase is resynthesised by cumulative integration of the interpolated instantaneous frequency — this is the key to preserving pitch.
3. The inverse CWT reconstructs the wavelet-captured component, scaled by a least-squares factor. A separately resampled residual (energy the CWT doesn't capture) is added back for full-bandwidth output.

### Pitch Shifting (Both)

Both applications use the same two-step strategy:

1. **Time-stretch** by the pitch ratio (2^(semitones/12)) — this changes duration without changing pitch.
2. **Resample** back to the target length — this shifts all frequencies by the desired ratio.

## Comparison

| | Phase Vocoder | Wavelet Processor |
|---|---|---|
| **Frequency resolution** | Linear (uniform FFT bins) | Logarithmic (perceptually spaced) |
| **Time resolution** | Fixed by FFT window size | Adaptive (finer at high frequencies) |
| **Reconstruction** | Near-perfect (overlap-add) | Approximate (residual-compensated) |
| **Transient handling** | Can smear attacks | Better preservation |
| **Computational cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Typical artefacts** | Metallic / phasey at extreme settings | Smoother but less precise |
| **Best for** | Tonal material, moderate stretches | Percussive material, speech |

## Troubleshooting

### No sound on playback
Both apps use callback-based `sounddevice.OutputStream` for Windows reliability. If you still get no audio, check that your default output device supports 44100 Hz in Windows Sound Settings.

### `pip install sounddevice` fails
Install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and retry.

### `python` not recognised
Try `py` instead, or use the full path: `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3xx\python.exe`.

### Processing is slow (wavelet)
The CWT is more computationally expensive than the STFT. For faster results, reduce the number of voices (24 or 36) or narrow the frequency range.
